# travel_api


This is a project for lmc 6313.
This is a practice of pulling Google Map API data.

Basically, users, also "wanderlusts", use our platform to explore the next step of their journey.
By clicking "explore new city", the website will randomly suggest a city for your plan with a short paragraph and the location on the google map.

Hope you enjoy it!
